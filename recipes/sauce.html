    <p><Strong>Instructions</Strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>  Combine oil and butter in medium saucepan and heat over medium-low heat until butter is melted. 
            Add garlic, oregano, pepper flakes, and large pinch salt and cook, stirring frequently, 
            until fragrant but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoe sauce, onion halves, basil sprigs, and sugar. 
            Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to lowest setting (bubbles should barely be breaking the surface), 
            and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 1 hour. Discard onions and basil stems. 
            Season to taste with salt. Allow to cool and store in covered container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. </li>
